# Philharmonic Workspace — Claude Code briefing

Personal development project for generic workflow orchestration
infrastructure. Rust crate family — most member crates are git
submodules, with an in-tree `xtask/` crate for workspace dev
tooling (never published).

Developer: Yuka MORI.

## Authoritative docs (read these, don't re-derive)

- [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) — **single authoritative home
  for workspace conventions.** Git workflow, script wrappers, POSIX
  shell rules, Rust code rules, versioning, licensing, terminology,
  journal formats, everything. When a rule seems to apply, read the
  relevant §here rather than restating. **When you change a
  convention in practice (new rule, changed rule, retired rule,
  or an ad-hoc rule that deserves to be authoritative), update
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` in the same commit** — see its §18.2.
- [`README.md`](README.md) — **whole-project executive summary.**
  Self-contained, concise, up-to-date. Will be fed to LLM
  sub-agents as the project's one-page mental model; structurally
  stale claims there are bugs. **When you change anything
  structurally visible (add/rename a crate, reshape the dep
  graph, complete a phase, reorganise `scripts/`), update
  `README.md` in the same commit** — see
  [`CONTRIBUTING.md §18.1`](CONTRIBUTING.md#181-readmemd--whole-project-executive-summary).
- [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) — **single authoritative home for any
  roadmap or plan.** Current phase, what's next, what's blocked,
  what was deferred and why. No parallel TODO lists or
  plans-of-record elsewhere. **When plans change (phase done, new
  blocker, deferred task, approach changed), update `ROADMAP.md`
  in the same commit as the work that changes them** — see
  [`CONTRIBUTING.md §16`](CONTRIBUTING.md#16-roadmap-maintenance)
  and
  [`§18.3`](CONTRIBUTING.md#183-roadmapmd--authoritative-home-for-plans).
- [`docs/design/`](docs/design/) — architectural design docs (what
  Philharmonic *is*, not how to develop on it).
- [`.claude/skills/`](.claude/skills/) — git-workflow,
  codex-prompt-archive, crypto-review-protocol. Invoke when their
  triggers fire.
- [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) — Codex's counterpart to this file.
- [`HUMANS.md`](HUMANS.md) — Yuka's note-to-self. **Agent-readable,
  agent-writable is forbidden.** `commit-all.sh` sweeps her pending
  edits into whatever commit is being made; that's the only way
  `HUMANS.md` changes reach the repo. See
  [`docs/instructions/README.md`](docs/instructions/README.md).

## Hard stops before doing anything

- **POSIX-ish host required.** Before running any script, spawning
  Codex, or attempting a Git state change, check the environment
  block's `Platform:` field. `linux` / `darwin` / `freebsd` /
  `openbsd` / `netbsd` / etc. → proceed. `win32` (raw Microsoft
  Windows) → **STOP IMMEDIATELY**, surface the mismatch, instruct
  the human to switch to WSL2. Do not run scripts, commit, or
  spawn Codex. The gate lives here because raw Windows can't
  execute `#!/bin/sh` in the first place. Git Bash / MSYS / Cygwin
  → proceed with caution, flag any submodule / signing / permission
  anomaly. See [`CONTRIBUTING.md §2`](CONTRIBUTING.md#2-development-environment).
- **Crypto-sensitive paths are gated.** SCK, COSE_Sign1,
  COSE_Encrypt0, hybrid KEM, payload-hash, `pht_` tokens — all
  trigger Yuka's two-gate personal review protocol via the
  `crypto-review-protocol` skill. See
  [`ROADMAP.md §5`](ROADMAP.md) and the skill.

## Claude vs. Codex division of labour

Claude Code is the designer, reviewer, and workspace caretaker.
Codex is the implementation partner for substantive coding.

- **Claude does:** architecture, API shape, design docs, ROADMAP
  updates, code review, workspace/repo management (scripts,
  `Cargo.toml` plumbing, submodule wrangling, doc reconciliation,
  small fixes that are really housekeeping). Maintenance coding
  stays with Claude — no Codex round-trip.
- **Codex does:** non-trivial concrete coding — a crate's actual
  implementation, an algorithm, a connector impl, test suites of
  real size. For those, Claude writes the prompt (archived first;
  see `codex-prompt-archive` skill), spawns Codex through the
  `codex:` plugin, and reviews what comes back.

Rule of thumb: "what should this look like?" → Claude. "Now
write the thing" → Codex, unless it's plumbing/housekeeping.

## Executive summary of the rules you'll trip over most

Every item here is the short form of something documented in
full in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Read the full section before acting
— this summary is a prompt, not a spec.

- **Ground yourself in JST time at session start.** Run
  `./scripts/xtask.sh calendar-jp` — prints a 5-week grid
  centred on today (JST), marks weekends and Japanese public
  holidays, lists each 祝日 in the window with its Japanese
  name, and shows the current JST wall-clock timestamp. Run
  it again whenever you reason about a deadline, a release
  window, a "before Thursday" commitment, or anything else
  where "today" and "which days are non-working" matter. The
  host's timezone and your training-data cutoff are both
  unreliable; this bin's output is authoritative for
  deadline reasoning on this project.
- **Work rhythm: never refuse on time, but note out-of-hours
  sessions as commentary.** Regular hours are 10:00–19:00 JST
  Mon–Fri; extended is fine up to 21:00; nights, weekends
  (土/日), and 祝日 are **allowed** (Yuka compensates herself
  separately for off-hours work) but **availability is not
  assumed** — don't queue work that needs a human hand-off at
  23:00 on a Sunday. If the current JST time from
  `calendar-jp` is outside regular hours, add a one-sentence
  note in your reply so the session transcript carries the
  context (*"(JST now 21:47 木 — outside regular hours;
  proceeding.)"*). The note is a log artefact, not a
  permission request — **never** stall or wait-for-morning
  because of the clock.
  ([CONTRIBUTING.md §8 → "Work rhythm and out-of-hours
  commentary"](CONTRIBUTING.md#work-rhythm-and-out-of-hours-commentary))
- **All Git state changes go through `scripts/*.sh`** —
  `status.sh`, `pull-all.sh`, `commit-all.sh`, `push-all.sh`,
  `heads.sh`. Never raw `git commit` / `git push` / `git add`
  outside the scripts. Every commit is `-s` sign-off + `-S`
  signature + `Audit-Info:` trailer; hooks enforce this.
  ([§4](CONTRIBUTING.md#4-git-workflow))
- **Git history is append-only.** No amend, no rebase, no reset,
  no force-push, and no `git revert` either. Two narrow
  script-enforced exceptions — the `post-commit`
  unsigned-rollback and `pull-all.sh`'s `--rebase`. Mistakes
  ship as new fix-forward commits only.
  ([§4.4](CONTRIBUTING.md#44-no-history-modification))
- **Push early, push often.** Mid-work pushes on `main` are
  encouraged — in an append-only world, unpushed commits can't
  be recovered if the local clone is lost. Hooks + GitHub
  ruleset accept WIP as long as it's signed, signed-off, and
  not force-pushed. ([§4.4](CONTRIBUTING.md#44-no-history-modification))
- **Prefer `scripts/*.sh` wrappers over raw `cargo`.** The
  wrappers encode flag choices, auto-install, workspace-cd,
  POSIX-compat guards. Read-only queries (`cargo tree`,
  `cargo metadata`) are fine raw. If no wrapper covers your
  case, extend one. ([§5](CONTRIBUTING.md#5-script-wrappers-over-raw-cargo))
- **Run `./scripts/pre-landing.sh` before every commit that
  touches Rust.** fmt + check + clippy (`-D warnings`) + test,
  auto-detecting modified crates. CI runs the same script.
  ([§11](CONTRIBUTING.md#11-pre-landing-checks))
- **Never recall a crate version from memory.** Always look up
  with `./scripts/xtask.sh crates-io-versions -- <crate>`. Local
  "what we're about to publish" comes from
  `./scripts/crate-version.sh`. ([§5.1](CONTRIBUTING.md#51-crate-version-lookup))
- **No panics in library `src/`.** No `.unwrap()` / `.expect()`
  on `Result`/`Option`, no `panic!` / `unreachable!` / `todo!`
  / `unimplemented!` on reachable paths, no unbounded indexing,
  no unchecked integer arithmetic, no lossy `as` casts on
  untrusted widths. Narrow exceptions need an inline
  justification. Tests / dev-deps / `xtask/` bins are exempt.
  ([§10.3](CONTRIBUTING.md#103-panics-and-undefined-behavior))
- **Library crates take bytes, not file paths.** File I/O,
  env-var lookup, config-file parsing belong in the bin.
  Crypto-adjacent APIs especially. ([§10.4](CONTRIBUTING.md#104-library-crate-boundaries))
- **Shell scripts are POSIX sh** (`#!/bin/sh`), not bash.
  Invoke by path (`./scripts/foo.sh`), never `bash foo.sh`.
  Validate with `./scripts/test-scripts.sh` after any change.
  ([§6](CONTRIBUTING.md#6-shell-script-rules-posix-sh))
- **No `python` / `perl` / `ruby` / `node` / `jq` / `curl` /
  `wget` in workspace tooling.** Shell for orchestration; Rust
  bins under `xtask/` for anything non-baseline. Use the
  `./scripts/mktemp.sh` and `./scripts/web-fetch.sh` wrappers
  for temp files and HTTP. ([§7](CONTRIBUTING.md#7-external-tool-wrappers),
  [§8](CONTRIBUTING.md#8-in-tree-workspace-tooling-xtask))
- **Every stable UUID (`KIND` consts, algorithm IDs) via
  `./scripts/xtask.sh gen-uuid -- --v4`.** Not `uuidgen`, not
  online generators, not `python -c "import uuid"`.
  ([§9](CONTRIBUTING.md#9-kind-uuid-generation))
- **Notes to humans.** When you tell Yuka anything substantial,
  also write it to
  `docs/notes-to-humans/YYYY-MM-DD-NNNN-<slug>.md` and commit
  via `./scripts/commit-all.sh --parent-only`. Session-only
  output isn't enough. ([§15.1](CONTRIBUTING.md#151-notes-to-humans))
- **Archive every Codex prompt** *before* spawning — write to
  `docs/codex-prompts/YYYY-MM-DD-NNNN-<slug>.md` and commit.
  See the `codex-prompt-archive` skill. ([§15.2](CONTRIBUTING.md#152-codex-prompt-archive))
- **Terminology follows §14.** Inclusive / neutral / technically
  accurate, FSF-preferred for free-software framing. Literal
  external identifiers (HTTP `Authorization`, `Win32`,
  `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`) stay as they ship.
- **Prose is in English by default** — commit messages, code
  comments, docs, notes-to-humans, PR/review text. Multilingual
  contributors' grammar/typo issues are **fixed best-effort in
  review**, never grounds to reject a contribution. Non-English
  text is explicitly allowed when it's the artefact (i18n
  strings, Unicode tests, literal external identifiers); add an
  English gloss alongside when the meaning isn't self-evident.
  ([§14.6](CONTRIBUTING.md#146-english-as-the-default))

## Memory / persistence policy

- **Workspace-scoped conventions belong in the repo, not in
  machine-local memory.** When a rule applies to *this project*
  ("prefer X over Y here"), its durable home is `CONTRIBUTING.md`
  (or one of the named living docs above) — not your
  per-agent-install memory store. Memory is per-machine and
  doesn't travel.
- **Machine-local memory is for genuinely machine-local facts.**
  "On this box, rustup/gh were installed on <date>." "This box
  is the Yuka-home WSL." That's it.

If you learn a repo-wide rule during a session, propose an edit
to `CONTRIBUTING.md` (or the relevant agent-facing doc) rather
than writing it to memory.

## Fresh clone

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/metastable-void/philharmonic-workspace.git
cd philharmonic-workspace
./scripts/setup.sh
```

`setup.sh` is idempotent. It configures submodule init,
`push.recurseSubmodules=check`, `core.hooksPath=.githooks`,
`commit.gpgsign=true` / `tag.gpgsign=true` /
`rebase.gpgsign=true`, and installs nightly+miri via rustup.
See [`CONTRIBUTING.md §1`](CONTRIBUTING.md#1-quick-start).
